# Learn GoLang Easily

## Golang objectives:

- Concurrency: Go has built-in concurrency support, which makes it easier to write concurrent and parallel programs. Other languages like Java has concurrency support as well, but it can be more complex and require more code to achieve the same results.

- Scalability: To satisfy the needs of contemporary distributed systems, Go was created to be able to manage big codebases and scale horizontally.

- Performance: Go was designed with performance in mind, This is partly due to Go's garbage collector, which is optimized for low-latency and high-throughput scenarios.

- Lightweight threads: goroutines and integrated concurrency mechanism make it simple to construct concurrent and parallel programmes.

- Efficiency: Go's garbage collector was designed to produce quick and efficient code in low-latency, high-throughput applications.

- Simple syntax: Go was created with an emphasis on readability and maintainability and a short, uniform language syntax to make it simple to learn and use.

- Cross-platform compatibility: Go was made to compile to a variety of platforms, making it simple to create programmes that work across several operating systems and architectures. 

- Deployment: Go produces a single binary file that is self contained. Which means this binary can be easily deployed to different platforms without dependencies. This makes it easier to distribute and deploy Go applications. 

## Self Contained Binaries

The Go compiler, which is a component of the Go installation, takes your source code and creates a binary executable file with all the required libraries and dependencies when you compile a Go program. The destination system does not need to have the Go installation or any other dependencies in order for this binary file to run because it is self-contained.

Because to this, it is simple to distribute and run Go applications across several platforms without worrying about the target system's Go version or any other requirements. 

## Python vs Java vs Go

## Syntax and Readability:
- Python: Python is known for its clean and readable syntax. It emphasizes code readability and simplicity.
- Java: Java has a more verbose syntax compared to Python, especially for tasks like exception handling and multithreading.
- Go: Go is designed with simplicity in mind. It has a clean and concise syntax, making it easy to read and write code.
## Concurrency:
- Python: Python has a Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) which can limit true multithreading. While it supports threads, it's often more suitable for I/O-bound tasks rather than CPU-bound tasks.
- Java: Java has built-in support for multithreading and provides features like Thread class and java.util.concurrent package for concurrent programming.
- Go: Go has Goroutines and channels, which are designed for concurrent programming. They provide a simpler and more efficient way to handle concurrency.
## Memory Management:
- Python: Python uses automatic garbage collection for memory management. It has reference counting as well as a garbage collector.
- Java: Java also uses automatic garbage collection for memory management, which can sometimes introduce pauses in the program.
- Go: Go also uses garbage collection, but it is optimized for low-latency, making it more suitable for real-time applications.
## Static vs. Dynamic Typing:
- Python: Python is dynamically-typed, meaning you don't need to declare the type of a variable before using it.
- Java: Java is a statically-typed language, which means you need to declare the type of a variable before using it.
- Go: Go is also statically-typed, but it has type inference which allows the compiler to infer the type of a variable based on the context.
## Concurrency Constructs:
- Python: Python has a threading module for concurrent programming, but due to the GIL, true parallelism can be limited. It also has the asyncio module for asynchronous programming.
- Java: Java provides Thread and Runnable interfaces for concurrent programming. It also has classes like Executor and ThreadPoolExecutor for managing thread pools.
- Go: Go provides Goroutines and channels, which are simpler and more efficient for concurrent programming. It promotes a "share memory by communicating" approach.
## Package Management:
- Python: Python has the pip package manager for installing and managing packages from the Python Package Index (PyPI).
- Java: Java uses tools like Maven and Gradle for package management and dependency resolution.
- Go: Go introduced go mod for dependency management, which makes it easy to manage packages and versions without relying on a central repository.
## Error Handling:
- Python: Python uses exceptions for error handling, which allows for clean and expressive error management.
- Java: In Java, it's common to use exceptions for error handling, which can lead to verbose code with many try-catch blocks.
- Go: Go uses explicit error values that are returned from functions, which leads to more straightforward error handling.
## Performance:
- Python: Python is generally slower compared to Java and Go, especially in CPU-intensive tasks.
- Java: Java can be highly optimized and is known for its performance, especially after the Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation phase.
- Go: Go compiles to native machine code, which often results in faster startup times and lower memory usage compared to Java.
## Standard Library:
- Python: Python has a comprehensive standard library known for its versatility and wide range of modules.
- Java: Java has a rich standard library with a wide range of APIs for various tasks, from networking to file I/O.
- Go: Go's standard library is also comprehensive and is known for its simplicity and consistency.
## Community and Ecosystem:
- Python: Python has a large and active community, extensive documentation, and a vast ecosystem of third-party libraries and frameworks.
- Java: Java has a well-established and mature ecosystem with a large community, extensive documentation, and a wide range of third-party libraries and frameworks.
- Go: Go's ecosystem is growing rapidly, and it is known for its active community, especially in areas like cloud-native development.
## Platform Independence:
- Python: Python is known for its portability and can run on various platforms without modification.
- Java: Java is designed to be platform-independent. Compiled Java code can run on any platform with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed.
- Go: Go compiles to machine code, making it platform-dependent. However, it is relatively easy to cross-compile Go code for different platforms.
Each of these languages has its strengths and is suitable for different types of projects. Python is known for its simplicity and versatility, Java is well-suited for enterprise-level applications, and Go is gaining popularity in areas like cloud computing and system-level programming. The choice between them depends on the specific requirements and constraints of a project.

## Why DevOps Applications are written in Golang ?

It is a known fact that popular devops applications such as Kubernetes, Docker and many are written in Golang. But why ? 

As Go was created with concurrency in mind, writing concurrent and parallel programs is made simpler. Applications for DevOps, which frequently need to handle numerous containers or processes at once, should pay special attention to this. This is one of the primary reasons why Golang is a popular choice in DevOps community.
